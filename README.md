todo:

- PUT morning routine (to complete fast, meditation)
  - limit routine to 1/day
  - introduce timer to meditation to make it more self-contained (voice recording too)
- update button stays after time passes (w/o updating percent when clicked)
- implement years
- preset schedule structures + time blocks (2.5h etc)
  (e.g. my structure rn is [([webdev OR alg] + prob) -> [math OR/THEN lCPP OR/THEN gamemath] -> draw]) ->
    turns into [graphql/next + econometrics/R] -> gamemath (eventually dasgupta/viz, and after that, networks) -> draw)
- deadline on morning routine?
- smarter date inputs + defaults
- card sharing
- goals on timeblocks
- notes on timeblocks
- modularize some functions in day-cardes
